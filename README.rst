============
Introduction
============

A harness for running evaluations on
`NeuroBench <https://neurobench.ai>`__ algorithm benchmarks.

This framework is in a beta state and is still under active development.
Currently, only pytorch-based models and frameworks are supported.
Extension of the harness to cover system track benchmarks in the future
is planned.

NeuroBench is a community-driven project, and we welcome further
development from the community. If you are interested in developing
extensions to features, programming frameworks, or metrics and tasks,
please see the `contributing guidelines <CONTRIBUTING.rst>`__.

NeuroBench Structure
---------------------

NeuroBench contains the following sections:

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 20 60

   * - **Section**
     - **Description**
   * - `neurobench.benchmarks <docs/neurobench.benchmarks.rst>`__
     - Neurobench benchmarks, including data metrics and static metrics
   * - `neurobench.datasets <docs/neurobench.datasets.rst>`__
     - Neurobench benchmark datasets
   * - `neurobench.models <docs/neurobench.models.rst>`__
     - Neurobench framework for Torch and SNNTorch models
   * - `neurobench.preprocessing <docs/neurobench.preprocessing.rst>`__
     - Pre-processing of data, conversion to spikes
   * - `neurobench.postprocessing <docs/neurobench.postprocessing.rst>`__
     - Post-processors take the spiking output from the models and provide several methods of combining them

Installation
------------

Install from PyPI:

::

   pip install neurobench

Benchmarks
----------

The following benchmarks are currently available:

v1.0 benchmarks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- `Keyword Few-shot Class-incremental Learning (FSCIL) <neurobench/examples/mswc_fscil>`__
- `Event Camera Object Detection <neurobench/examples/obj_detection>`__
- `Non-human Primate (NHP) Motor Prediction <neurobench/examples/primate_reaching>`__
- `Chaotic Function Prediction <neurobench/examples/mackey_glass>`__

Additional benchmarks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- `DVS Gesture Recognition <neurobench/examples/dvs_gesture>`__
- `Google Speech Commands (GSC) Classification <neurobench/examples/gsc>`__
- `Neuromorphic Human Activity Recognition (HAR) <neurobench/examples/nehar>`__

Getting started
---------------

Example benchmark scripts can be found under the ``neurobench/examples``
folder.

In general, the design flow for using the framework is as follows:

1. Train a network using the train split from a particular dataset.
2. Wrap the network in a ``NeuroBenchModel``.
3. Pass the model, evaluation split dataloader, pre-/post-processors,
   and a list of metrics to the ``Benchmark`` and ``run()``.

Documentation for the framework interfaces can found in
`API.md <API.md>`__.

Development
-----------

If you clone the repo directly for development, poetry can be used to
maintain a virtualenv consistent with a deployment environment. In the
root directory run:

::

   poetry install
   poetry run pytest tests/

Currently the end-to-end examples can be run from the root directory
via:

::

   poetry run python neurobench/examples/dvs_gesture/benchmark.py
   poetry run python neurobench/examples/gsc/benchmark.py
   poetry run python neurobench/examples/mackey_glass/benchmark.py
   poetry run python neurobench/examples/primate_reaching/benchmark.py

The examples may not yet have trained models or a full set of metrics.
