Contribution Guidelines
=======================

As a community-driven project, we welcome further development from the community. If you are interested in developing extensions to features, programming frameworks, or metrics and tasks, please follow these steps:

1. Select or open a new `issue <https://github.com/NeuroBench/algorithms_benchmarks/issues>`_ to discuss your idea.
   - Please look out for tasks which are associated with a particular milestone like ``v1.0``, have a ``help wanted`` tag, or don't have any assignees!
2. Fork the repository and create a new branch.
3. Develop your feature.
4. Add tests and documentation. We are using `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/>`_ for testing, and `Google docstrings <https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html>`_ for documentation. Tests should go into the ``neurobench/tests`` directory.
5. Open a pull request to the ``dev`` branch to merge your branch into the main repository.

Please feel free to reach out to the maintainers with questions about contributing!
