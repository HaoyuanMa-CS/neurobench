MSE
===================

Definition
----------
Mean Squared Error (MSE) is defined as the average of the squared differences between the predicted and the actual values. The formula for MSE is:

.. math::
    MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y_i})^2

where :math:`y_i` is the actual value, :math:`\hat{y_i}` is the predicted value, and :math:`n` is the number of samples.
