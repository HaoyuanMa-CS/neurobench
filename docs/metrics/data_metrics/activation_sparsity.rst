===================
Activation Sparsity
===================

Definition
----------
During execution, the average sparsity of neuron activations over all neurons in all model layers, for all timesteps of all tested samples, where 0 refers to no sparsity (i.e., all neurons are always activated), and 1 refers to the case where all neurons have a zero output.
