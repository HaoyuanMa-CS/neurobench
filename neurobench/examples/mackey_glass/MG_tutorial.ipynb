    "# Mackey Glass Benchmark Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial aims to provide an insight on how the NeuroBench framework is organized and how you can use it to benchmark your own models!\n",
    "\n",
    "## About Mackey Glass:\n",
    "The Mackey Glass task is a chaotic function prediction task. Contrary to the other tasks in NeuroBench, the Mackey Glass dataset is synthetic. Real-world data can be high-dimensional and require large networks to achieve high accuracy, presenting challenges for solution types with limited I/O support and network capacity, such as mixed-signal prototype solutions. \n",
    "### Dataset:\n",
    "The Mackey Glass dataset is a one-dimensional non-linear time delay differential equation, where the evolution of the signal can be altered by a number of different parameters. \n",
    "<!-- $$ dx \\over dt = \\beta {x(t-\\tau)} \\over {1 + x(t-\\tau)^n} - \\gamma x(t)\n",
    "$$ -->\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{\\beta x(t-\\tau)}{1 + x(t-\\tau)^n} - \\gamma x(t) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the NeuroBench task, fourteen time series are generated from the Mackey Glass function, available at this link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/NeuroBench/mackey_glass. The time series vary by the $\\tau$ parameter from 17 to 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benchmark Task:\n",
    "The task is a sequence-to-sequence prediction problem, similar to the non-human primate motor prediction task, which is also included in NeuroBench. The task involves predicting the next timestep value $f(t+\\Delta t)$, from the current value $f(t)$. Models are trained on the first half of the time series, during which the ground truth state $f(t)$ is provided to the model to make its prediction $f'(t+\\Delta t)$. During evaluation on the second half of the sequence, the model uses its prior prediction $f'(t)$ in order to generate each next value $f'(t+\\Delta t)$, autoregressively generating the second half of the time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Symmetric mean absolute percentage error, sMAPE, is used to evaluate the correctness of the model's prediction. The length of the time series is dependent on Lyapunov time, which is listed with the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "The task presented in this tutorial uses multiple instances of each Mackey Glass configuration, each with length or 20 Lyapunov times. Each successive instance shifts the start point of the time series forwards by half of a Lyapunov time. The metrics are averaged over all instances."
