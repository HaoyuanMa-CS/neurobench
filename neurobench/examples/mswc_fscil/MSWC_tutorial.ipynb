        "Learning new tasks from a small amount of experiences while retaining knowledge of prior tasks is a hallmark of biological intelligence and a long-standing goal of general AI. It is especially a key challenge to endow edge devices with the ability to adapt to their environments and users. This benchmark thus evaluates the capacity of a model to successively incorporate new keywords over multiple sessions (class-incremental), with only a handful of samples from the new classes to train with (few-shot). The FSCIL task is a recently established benchmark in the computer vision domain, but it has not yet been adapted to other data modalities. \n",

        "### Dataset:\n",
        "Aligning with a neuromorphic interest in temporal data modalities, this benchmark introduces a FSCIL task with streaming audio data using the large Multilingual Spoken Word Corpus (MSWC) keyword classification dataset. The task is designed to be approached in two phases: pre-training and incremental learning. First, for pre-training, a set of 100 words spanning 5 base languages (English, German, Catalan, French, Kinyarwanda) with 500 training samples each are made available to train an initial model. Next, for incremental learning, the model undergoes 10 successive sessions to learn words from 10 new languages (Persian, Spanish, Russian, Welsh, Italian, Basque, Polish, Esparanto, Portuguese, Dutch) in a few-shot learning scenario. Each incremental session adds 10 words of the corresponding session language with only 5 training samples available per word. After each session, the model is tested in classification accuracy on all prior learned classes, including the 100 base pre-training classes and the few-shot-learned classes, therefore evaluating the FSCIL solution on its ability to learn new classes while retaining knowledge about the previously learned ones. Each session learns a new language, for a total knowledge base of 200 keywords by the end of the benchmark.\n",
